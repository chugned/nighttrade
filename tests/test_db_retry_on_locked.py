"""Tests for retry-with-backoff on SQLite 'database is locked' errors.

Bug history (P4-2): on 2026-06-02 at 03:50 the observer logged
``sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`` for one symbol (SW).
That one symbol was skipped, the cycle continued — low impact, but
the bot SHOULD just retry briefly instead of dropping the write. WAL
mode + ``timeout=10s`` on connect already absorb most contention, but
edge cases like a concurrent ``wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`` or a
long-held read snapshot can still bubble the error to Python.

This file exercises the contract of the ``_RetryingConnection``
proxy. The proxy:

- Wraps ``sqlite3.Connection.execute`` and ``commit``.
- On ``OperationalError`` containing 'locked' or 'busy', retries with
  exponential backoff up to ``max_retries`` times.
- Re-raises other ``OperationalError`` immediately (no false retry on
  schema/SQL errors).
- Passes everything else through unchanged.
